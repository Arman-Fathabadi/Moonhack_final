              Ahmadreza Azizi is a key member of our project, leading the
              integration of artificial intelligence. With his specialized
              skills, he ensures the project produces accurate questions and
              insightful tutorials. He develops personalized tutorials from user
              queries, enhancing user experience. Despite his technical role, he
              values ethical considerations, particularly user privacy and data
              security. His balanced approach between technology and ethics
              forms a strong foundation for our project.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-2">Arman</h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Under Arman Fathabadi's leadership, the initial project phase
              focuses on front-end development and design, which is critical as
              it shapes user impressions and overall experience. This includes
              creating the landing page, our platform's virtual front door.
              Arman ensures it is not only visually appealing but easy to
              navigate, effectively communicating our platform's purpose and
              value. In addition, Arman collaborated with Kasra Sanati on the
              front end of the 'Chat Screen,' preparing it for the backend
              integration. Following this, Arman leads the development of the
              'About Us' section, an opportunity to share our story, mission,
              values, and team, fostering a connection with users.

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Under Kasra Sanati's guidance, we'll initially focus on developing
              our website's front end, which significantly influences user
              perceptions and engagement. Kasra ensures the front end, our
              users' primary interface, is well-constructed. We'll also develop
              a 'Contact' page, enabling open communication with users, and a
              'Chat Screen' page. This serves as a dynamic interface connecting
              users with tutorials and answers, functioning as a personalized
              assistant. Users can input queries, and the front and back end
              work together to provide tailored responses, enhancing the user
              experience.

              Mahdiar Khodabakhshi plays a crucial role in our project, focusing
              on creating, managing, and analyzing data structures. His work
              forms the platform's backbone, ensuring the efficient
              functionality of complex algorithms. He sets up a system for quick
              retrieval and storage of key information like user data and
              tutorials. Mahdiar's analysis aids in refining AI algorithms,
              improving design, and enhancing user experience. His data
